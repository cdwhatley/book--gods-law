      <p>You might have heard it taught that Christians are not obligated to obey God’s Law (aka., Mosaic Law) but to obey Christ’s Law.  Is this true?  If so, what is Christ’s Law?  Is it different from God’s Law?</p>
      <p>When those that teach this theology are asked what Christ’s Law is, they usually give the following answer.</p>
      <p><i>Christ’s Law is the law of love.  It is made up of only two commands.
        <ol class="christ-law-list">
          <li>Love God with all your heart, soul, and mind.</li>
          <li>Love your neighbor as yourself.</li>
        </ol>
      </i></p>
      <p>Matthew 22 is the basis for this theology.</p>

      <p>The first thing to note is that those two commandments are  from the Torah (God’s Law).</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.<br></span>

      <h2 class=section-title>6.2 All The Law Hangs on the Two Greatest Commandments</h2>

      </audio>            
      <p>The second thing to note is what Yeshua says in Matthew 22:40 –on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  Proponents of Christ’s Law theology say this means you only have to obey these two – all of the other commandments in the Torah are no longer required to be obeyed.</p>
      <p>Matthew 22:40 is saying that these two commandments are the summarization of all the commandments in the Torah and the preaching of the Hebrew prophets.  So if you are obeying these two, you will not be breaking one of the other commandments in the Torah.</p>
      <p>The Ten Commandments is a summarization of all the other commandments in the Torah.  Each of the commandments of God’s Law can be mapped to (or rolled up into) one of these ten.  Then the Ten Commandments can be rolled up into the two commandments Yeshua recited in Matthew 22.  The first 4 of the 10 deal with our relationship with God (and are rolled up into loving God with all of ourselves (Deuteronomy 6:5)) and the other 6 deal with our relationship with our fellow man (and are rolled up into loving our neighbor as ourselves (Leviticus 19:18)).</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>6.3 Who is Christ?</h2>

      </audio>            
      <p>The third point to consider is the issue of who Christ is.  Is He deity (i.e, Is Yeshua God)?  John chapter 1 answers that question for us.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br></span>
        <cite>John 1:1 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The prophet Isaiah also reveals that the Messiah would be divine (God in the flesh) in Isaiah 9:6.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.<br></span>
        <cite>Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So if Yeshua is God (noted in the role of son), and God the Father is God, and Yeshua says that He and the Father are one, then it only makes sense that Christ’s Law is God’s Law.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">"The Father and I are one."<br></span>
        <cite>John 10:30 (NLT)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>9</sup>Jesus replied, <br></span>
        <span class="verse-redletter">“Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and yet you still don’t know who I am? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why are you asking me to show him to you? <sup>10</sup>Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me. <sup>11</sup>Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do”.<br></span>
