      <p>The next question we will answer is "Who is God's Law for?".  That question begs the following question, "Who was God's Law given to? Wasn't it only given to the Jews?"</p>
      <p>Exodus 12:38 tells us that when the Israelites left Egypt the night of the first Passover, they left as part of a “mixed multitude".</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">And a <b><i>mixed multitude</i></b> went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.<br /></span>
        <cite>Exodus 12:38 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Holman Christian Standard Bible translation of this verse defines what a “mixed multitude” is – an ethnically diverse group.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">An <b><i>ethnically diverse crowd</i></b> also went up with them, along with a huge number of livestock, both flocks and herds.<br /></span>
        <cite>Exodus 12:38 (HSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Dictionary.com defines “ethnic” as an adjective which means:</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-block">pertaining to or characteristic of a people, especially a group (ethnic group) sharing a common and distinctive culture, religion, language, or the like.<br></span>
        <cite><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ethnic?s=t">dictionary.com</a></cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This mixed multitude, then, was comprised of several ethnic groups – native Israelites and probably slaves from other nations as well as some Egyptians.  It only makes sense that others would leave Egypt with the Israelites, especially Egyptians, because Egypt was in ruins.  For one, there was sure to be a famine because the crops had been wiped out by the plagues of hail (7th plague) and locusts (8th plague), and another plague had wiped out all the cattle of Egypt (5th plague). The hail most assuredly had damaged many homes and businesses.  Also, the plagues were sent by God to show the Egyptians that He is God alone.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.”<br></span>
        <cite>Exodus 7:5 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Each plague was designed to discredit one or more Egyptian gods.  A great article that describes this can be found at 
      <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/ten-plagues-Egypt.html">Got Questions</a>.</p>
      <p>It was this “mixed multitude” that traveled to Mount Sinai in Arabia where God spoke audibly to all of them His 10 commandments, and afterwards, spoke to them the rest of His Law through Moses.</p>
      <p>God’s Law was to be followed by the entire multitude as well as by any other person or group that would join the Israelites in the future.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“You will have the same Law for the stranger and for the one born among you. For I am the Lord your God”.<br></span>
        <cite>Leviticus 24:22 (NLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“<sup>15</sup>Native-born Israelites and foreigners are equal before the LORD and are subject to the same decrees.  This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation.  <sup>16</sup>The same instructions and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigners living among you.”<br></span>
        <cite>Numbers 15:15-16 (NLT) </cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This “mixed multitude” was collectively referred to by God in the Torah as “the children of Israel”, or more simply “the Israelites”, or just “Israel”.</p>
      <p>So we’ve established that God’s Law was given to Israel and that Israel was composed of both native born Israelites as well as foreigners (gentiles) who joined the native-born to follow the God of Israel.</p>
      <p>And as a side note, to be discussed in detail later, Numbers 15:15 states the Law was to be “forever” binding for all the children of Israel throughout all their generations.</p>
