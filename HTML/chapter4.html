      <p>Israel today has a few definitions.</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>4.1 Physical Israel (Native-Born)</h2>

      <p>The only native-born Israelites we can identify today are the Jewish people.  The Jews got their name because they were the Israelites that lived in Judah – the southern kingdom of Israel when Israel split into two kingdoms.  The southern kingdom is called Judea in the New Testament scriptures.  The story of the split of the nation is told starting in 1<sup>st</sup> Kings chapter 11 and 2<sup>nd</sup> Chronicles chapter 10.</p>
      <p>The Jews were primarily from the tribe of Judah, with some from the tribe of Benjamin, and others from the tribe of Levi.  In the split of the nation, God said ten tribes would split off from the House of David and two tribes would remain.  The ten tribes became the northern kingdom and retained the name Israel.  The other two tribes became the southern kingdom and took the name Judah, or Judea.</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>4.2 State of Israel</h2>

      <p>The State of Israel is the modern day nation of Israel that is established in the land that God calls His in Leviticus 25:23, which He allotted to the physical children of Israel.</p>

      <p>As stated earlier (in <a href="chapter4.html">“Isn’t God’s Law Only for the Jews?”</a>), the Israelites were composed of both native-born Israelites and Gentiles that chose to live among them.</p>

      <h3>4.2.1 State of Israel Citizens</h3>
      <p>Today, citizens of the State of Israel are composed of Jews, Arabs, and other Gentiles.  The State of Israel is primarily Jewish (approximately 75%).</p>

      <p>Paul talks about spiritual Israel in his letters.  It gets real confusing real fast, especially when he says “not all who are Israel are Israel”.  Spiritual Israel is God’s people, His family – people who have decided to follow and serve the God of Israel.</p>
      <p>In Romans 11, Paul refers to physical Israel as a cultivated olive tree.  (Jeremiah also identifies Israel as a green (prosperous) olive tree in Jeremiah 11).  Paul refers to Gentiles as a wild olive tree.  He says that when a Gentile accepts the God of Israel as his/her God by accepting His salvation (through Jesus), that Gentile is a branch from the wild olive tree that gets grafted into the natural olive tree, Israel.  <b><i>So when a Gentile is born again, he/she becomes part of Israel</i></b>.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>16</sup>The LORD called your name, “A green olive tree, fair in fruit and form.”  With the noise of a great tumult He has kindled fire upon it, and its branches are broken.  <sup>17</sup>For the LORD of Hosts, who planted you, has pronounced disaster against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering incense to Baal.<br></span>
        <cite>Jeremiah 11:16-17 (MEV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>17</sup>Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, <sup>18</sup>do not brag that you are better than those branches.  But if you do brag — you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you.  <sup>19</sup>Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”  <sup>20</sup>True enough; they were broken off by unbelief, but you stand by faith.  Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.  <sup>21</sup>For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either.  <sup>22</sup>Therefore, consider God’s kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen but God’s kindness toward you — if you remain in His kindness.  Otherwise you too will be cut off.  <sup>23</sup>And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God has the power to graft them in again.  <sup>24</sup>For if you were cut off from your native wild olive tree and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these — the natural branches — be grafted into their own olive tree?<br></span>

      <p>Paul clearly states that Gentile believers become part of Israel in Ephesians 2.  There he states that before salvation, Gentiles had no inheritance from God.  But when salvation comes, they become <b><i>citizens of Israel</i></b>.</p>
     <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>11</sup>Therefore, keep in mind that once you — Gentiles in the flesh — were called “uncircumcision” by those called “circumcision” (which is performed on flesh by hand).  <sup>12</sup>At that time you were separate from Messiah, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.  <sup>13</sup>But now in Messiah Yeshua, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah. … <sup>19</sup>So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household.<br></span>

      <p>So why is it important to know that Gentile Christians are now citizens of Israel?  Because God gave his Law to Israel – both native-born Israelites (Judah and the other tribes) <b><i>and</i></b> the Gentiles that joined the native-born to follow the God of Israel (Exodus 12:38).  <b><i>So God’s Law is for physical Israel (Jews) and for spiritual Israel (all born-again believers).  It is so important to understand that spiritual Israel does not replace physical Israel.</i></b>  Spiritual Israel is <b><i>joined</i></b> to physical Israel, or as Paul says, is grated in.  This means all the blessings promised to physical Israel are also promised to spiritual Israel <b><i>and all the responsibilities</i></b> of physical Israel are also responsibilities of spiritual Israel.</p>
      <p>What I am stating here is not Replacement Theology.  I guess you could call it “Addition Theology” or “Expansion Theology”.  Spiritual Israel does not replace physical Israel, but is added to it, or expands it.  Remember that God said in Exodus for the Israelites to treat the foreigner, or stranger, of Israel the same as the native-born of Israel.  They were one in His eyes, just as Israel today is one in His eyes.  So <b>Israel = Physical Israel + Spiritual Israel</b>.</p>
      <p>Important to note here is that God’s Law was given to His people Israel (native-born Israelites + grated-in Gentiles).  Exodus shows that this occurred <b><i>after</i></b> they were saved (by the blood of the lamb on the very first Passover in Egypt). <b><i>Salvation came first and was not dependent upon them following God’s Law</i></b>.  God never changes (Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8, and James 1:17).  So it is the same today.  <b><i>Salvation is a free gift that we cannot earn by following God’s Law</i></b>.  But once we are saved and become part of God’s family (Israel), He becomes our parent and we, His children.  So we are to live by His rules.</p>
     <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>8</sup>For by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not from yourselves – it is the gift of God.  <sup>9</sup>It is not based on deeds so that no one may boast.  <sup>10</sup>For we are His workmanship – created in Messiah Yeshua for good deeds, which God prepared beforehand so we might walk in them.<br></span>
