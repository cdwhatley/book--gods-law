        <span class="verse-redletter">“<sup>23</sup>But an hour is coming - it is here now - when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people as His worshipers. <sup>24</sup>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”<br></span>
        <cite>John 4:23-24 (TLV)</cite>

      <p>We can worship God by singing songs and hymns to Him and through praying, where we exalt God and thank Him for his characteristics of love, grace, forgiveness, etc. as well as His mighty deeds.  In this way, worshipping God goes hand-in-hand with praising God.  This is the definition that most Christians think of for worshipping God.</p>
      <p>Is this the only way to worship God? What exactly does it mean to worship God?  A good place to start looking for the answer is the Hebrew word used for worship, which is Strongs # H7812.  H7812 is transliterated as “shachah”.</p>
      <p>Shachah means:</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-block">to bow down or prostrate oneself before a superior in special honor or respect.<br></span>
        <cite>Brown-Driver-Briggs Concordance and Strong's Concordance</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When we physically and sincerely bow before God, it means we are submitting ourselves to His rule.  This is also known as humbling yourself.  The verb humble is defined by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary as:</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-block">to lower in dignity or importance<br></span>
        <cite>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>while Webster’s 1828 dictionary defines the verb humble as:</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-block">to make meek and submissive to the divine will<br></span>
        <cite>Webster's 1828 Dictionary</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Since we now see that worshipping God is submitting to his rule, which is symbolically pictured by physically bowing before Him, we now understand that the core of worshipping God is obeying Him.  Through obeying God’s commandments given in His Word, with the foundation in the Torah, we worship God in truth.  In fact, the Psalmist tells us in Psalm 119 that God’s Torah is truth.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Your justice is righteousness forever, and <u>Your Torah is truth</u>.<br></span>
        <cite>Psalm 119:142 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If we live our lives in open rebellion to His Torah, then when we worship God through singing and praise, we are NOT worshipping Him in truth.  In this case, our worship of Him is in vain.  This is taught by Jesus in Mark chapter 7 when He quoted Isaiah 29:13.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“<sup>6</sup>Rightly did Isaiah prophecy about you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. <sup>7</sup>And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men”.<br></span>
        <cite>Mark 7:6-7 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>   
      <p>Also, we are to worship God in spirit (i.e., to be led by His Holy Spirit).  We have to have His Spirit living in us in order to worship in spirit which means that only born-again believers can worship God in spirit.  Since we live in sinful bodies and a fallen world, we cannot obey His Torah without the power of His Holy Spirit working inside of us.  In addition, His Holy Spirit will not guide us to worship Him in a way that is contrary to truth (i.e, in a way that will break His Torah).</p>
      <p>So if we worship God in spirit but not in truth, we worship God in vain, as stated by Jesus in Mark chapter 7.  On the flip side, if we worship God in truth, but not in spirit, our worship is also in vain because it is not sincere.  In this case, we are just going through the motions of performing God’s commandments while our heart is not in it.  That’s why it is so important to know God’s commandments and also to keep the desire to love and obey him aflame in our hearts.</p>

      <p>What happens when we worship God in our own way, not according to the truth of God’s Word?  We get the slippery moral slope away from God’s ways that is so prevalent in today’s society.  This slide down the moral slope away from God started the moment the Church adopted the doctrine that God’s Law is not valid because it has been made void by Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.  This doctrine became mainstream during the 4<sup>th</sup> century AD, but probably started sometime in the early 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD.</p>
      <p>The ramifications of the doctrine that God’s Law is not relevant (i.e., valid) for today are many.  The main problem, however, is that we put ourselves (mankind) in charge of determining what is right and what is wrong.  This is NOT humbling ourselves before God but acting in pride and arrogance, in essence telling God we know better than He does.</p>
      <p>Some of the ramifications of replacing God’s Law with our own moral law is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We can change what we believe is right or wrong at any point in time. (There is no golden, unchanging standard of righteousness).</li>
        <li>The Church looks and lives like the World and therefore is not serving as a light in the darkness (i.e, lack of holiness (Godliness) in the Church).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please see <a href="appendixA.html">Appendix A</a> for details about the rapid decline in our society away from Biblical morality (coming soon).</p>
