      <p><u>Background</u></p>
      <p>Mainstream Christianity divides God’s law into categories.  The most common categories are:</u></p>
      <ul class=law-divisions-list>
        <li>Moral Law</li>
        <li>Cermonial Law</li>
        <li>Civil Law</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some others also add a 4th category: Dietary Law</p>
      <p>Each category is summarized as follows.</p>
      <p><u>Civil Law</u></p>      
      <p>These are laws for living in a community.  They deal with how to handle and or punish:</p>      
      <ul class=law-divisions-list>
        <li>Murder</li>
        <li>Theft</li>
        <li>Kidnapping</li>
        <li>Divorce</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Ceremonial Law</u></p>
      <p>These deal with special appointments for God and His people to come together.</p>
      <ul class=law-divisions-list>
        <li>Holidays</li>
        <li>Sabbath</li>
        <li>Temple sacrificial system</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Dietary Law</u></p>
      <p>Definition of what is food and what is not</p>

      <p><u>Moral Law</u></p>
      <p>Defines right and wrong</p>
      <ul class=law-divisions-list>
        <li>What deeds are acceptable and what deeds are not</li>
        <li>How to live in relationship to God and to others</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Traditional Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>Mainline Christianity states that all categories of God’s Law are not applicable to Christians except for the Moral Law.</p> 
      <p>Catholicism teaches that God’s Law is a preparation for the Gospel, and therefore is no longer binding.  The New Law is the Law of the Gospel.  It is a perfection of the Mosaic Law and was given by Jesus in His Sermon on the Mount.</p>
      <p>The Reformed teaching is that the Moral Law was first given to Adam and then later to Moses, in the form of the Ten Commandments.  It is eternal and therefore binding on Christians to obey. Ceremonial Law was abolished in the New Testament, as well as Civil Law, which only concerned the State of Israel.</p> 
      <p>Dispensationalism, which is taught in most Evangelical denominations (Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Non-denominational, etc.), makes a distinction between Israel and the Church in God’s plan.  Dispensationalism divides history into dispensations, or blocks of time.  In each dispensation, God deals differently with His people than he dealt in previous dispensations.</p>
      <p>Two of the primary dispensations are:</p>
      <ul class=law-divisions-list>
        <li>Law (before Christ)</li>
        <li>Grace (since Christ’s death, aka, the Church age)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The dispensation of Law is when God managed His people through use of His Law.  However, once Jesus died for the sins of humanity and rose again, the Church age began, wherein God deals with His people through grace.  Therefore, the Law is now invalid.</p>
      <p>Since Dispensationalists separate Israel from the Church, they believe that the Law was always only for Israel (the Jewish people).  They believe that God is now focusing his attention on His Church, but in the future, during the 1000 year Millennial Reign, when Jesus will be back on Earth to reign as King of the Earth, God will again switch His focus back to Israel.</p>
      <p><u>Counter Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>So…. is any of the above Biblical?  Well, we certainly are allowed to categorize things.  Many times, categorizing helps us better understand a system by breaking it into smaller pieces.  Then we can focus on each piece, followed by the relationship of the pieces to each other.  That’s all well and good unless doing so ultimately alters the correct understanding of the system as a whole.</p>
      <p>It's my opinion that this is exactly what has happened by categorizing God’s Law.  Yeshua himself said in Matt 5:17-19 that he did not come to abolish the Law and the prophets, but to fulfill them (i.e., fill them up with meaning – help us understand their full meaning).  For commandment after commandment God gave in the Torah, you will see that He says to do that commandment forever.  He didn’t say do it until the Messiah comes.</p>
      <p>But the Church, when categorizing God’s Law, declares that many of the categories do not apply to God’s people.  Occasionally, you will see some say that some of the categories still apply to the Jewish people, but that all categories, with exception of the Moral category, do not apply to Christians.</p>
      <p>I think there is one fundamental disconnect in this theology:  <b>The Church thinks of itself as a separate entity from Israel.</b></p>
      <p>Is the Church a separate group from Israel? The Scriptures say <b>NO</b>.  This idea is in direct opposition to Ephesians chapter 2, where Paul states that believers from the nations (non Jews) are grafted into Israel.  He says Gentiles by birth that are saved are now part of the commonwealth of Israel (fellow citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household).  (See <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
      <p>Also, Jesus said when speaking to Jews in John 10:16 that he has sheep that are not of that fold (Jewish fold), but that He will bring them together with the Jewish fold to form one flock</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">I have other sheep that are not from this fold; those also I must lead, and they will listen to My voice. So there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.<br></span>
        <cite>John 10:16 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If we are one, then the same rules should apply for the entire group.  That’s logical, but is it Biblical?  Yes it is.  God states in the Torah, that for the mixed population He brought out of Egypt to take to the Promised Land, a group comprised of native Israelites and those from other nations, there would be one law for all.  He states in Exodus 12:49, “there is one law for the native Israelite and those that sojourn with you”.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">There shall be one law for the native and the stranger that sojourns among you.<br></span>
        <cite>Exodus 12:49 (ESV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Church loves to claim promises given directly to Israel, but at the same time, they say they do not bear the same responsibilities as Israel.  So the Church gets all the benefits without having to bear any of the responsibilities, except the great commission, which is to preach the Gospel to all the nations.</p>
      <p>The Bible, however, makes it plain that God has one people, and its name is Israel.  Those who are not born into it, can become part of it, through making Israel’s God their God.  Paul refers to this group as Spiritual Israel.  It’s made up of both native born Israelites and those from the nations, both of whom have accepted Yeshua as their savior.  In that way, some of the branches of the Olive Tree of Israel are broken off (non believing native born) and those from the nations that believe are grafted in.  The great news is that in the end times, many, many Jews will have their spiritual eyes opened and see that Yeshua, their brother, is the Messiah, and will accept his atonement for their sins!  This is happening even now.  God has gathered many of His people back to the land of Israel, and now there is a spiritual revival going on there.  This has been building for years and is still gaining momentum.</p>
