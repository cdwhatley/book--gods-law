      <p>But, wasn’t God’s Law nailed to the Cross making it null and void?  If so, the Law is no longer valid for either physical or spiritual Israel.</p>

      <p>Was God lying in Numbers 15:16 when he said that His Law is forever?</p>
      <p>God even made the point to remind us about His Law being forever when giving specific instructions in the Torah.</p>

      <p>Jesus even clearly stated that He did not come to Earth to end God’s Law.  Instead He came to fulfill it.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">

      <p>In Matthew 5:17, “abolish” is the Greek word “kataluo” (Strong G2647).  The word means “to demolish, destroy, throw down, overthrow”.</p>
      <p>“Fulfill” is the Greek word “pleroo” (Strongs G4137).  Pleroo could mean “to make full” or it could mean “finish a period or task; to accomplish; to end”.  The meaning depends on how the word is used in the passage.  Traditional Christianity has interpreted “pleroo” here to mean “finish, accomplish, end”.</p>
      <p>But if that is indeed the correct interpretation, then Jesus’ own words in Matthew 5:17 contradict themselves.  In essence He would have been saying, “I did not come to abolish (destroy or overthrow) the Law, but to finish/end it”.  I think we can all agree if something is destroyed or overthrown, it is no longer used, effectively ending its life.  So Jesus would be saying He didn’t come to end the Law but to end the Law.</p>
      <p>The meaning of “pleroo” that matches the context of what Jesus said is “to make full”.  This could mean to make full the understanding of the Law, in essence filling it up with meaning.  That makes sense when looking at the many points Jesus made in that same conversation, known as the Sermon on the Mount.  For instance, he stated that the law to not commit adultery has a fuller meaning than just the physical act.  He said that if a man even looks at a woman in lust, he has broken the commandment.</p>
      <p>Jesus goes on to say that not even the smallest letter or marking in the Torah would be made invalid until Heaven and Earth pass away and all things are accomplished.  The fact that we are still here on Earth means God’s Law is still valid.</p>

      <p>When a person breaks a governmental law (law of the land), there is a penalty to be paid.  It’s the same with God’s Law.  When any person breaks God’s Law (i.e. commits a sin), there is a penalty that must be paid.  Each person is responsible for paying his/her own penalty.  Ultimately that penalty for breaking God’s Law is eternal separation from God, i.e. death.</p>

      <p>It was that penalty for our sins (for our breaking of God’s Law) that was nailed to the cross, not God’s Law itself, as stated in Colossians 2.</p>
