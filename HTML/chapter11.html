        <span class="verse-text"><sup>13</sup>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; <sup>14</sup>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.</u><br></span>
        <cite>Colossians 2:13-14 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><u>Traditional Interpretation</u></p>  
      <p>God's Law (referred to in Colossians 2:14 as "the handwriting of ordinances that was against us") died when Christ died on the Cross. It does not apply to saved believers in Jesus.</p>  
      <p><u>Counter Scriptures</u></p>  
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>13</sup>When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with Him when He pardoned us all our transgressions. <sup>14</sup>He wiped out the handwritten record of debts with the decrees against us, which was hostile to us. He took it away by nailing it to the cross.</u><br></span>
        <cite>Colossians 2:13-14 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>13</sup>You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. <sup>14</sup>He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross.</u><br></span>
        <cite>Colossians 2:13-14 (NLT)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><u>Counter Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>Simply reading the same verses from other Bible versions adds clarity to the meaning. There certainly was something else besides Messiah that was nailed to the Cross, but it was not God's Law. Instead it was the charges against us (or written record of debt that we owed God) for our own sins.  This is a debt that we cannot pay, resulting in eternal damnation. But, most thankfully (hallelujah!) Christ paid that debt for us on the cross!</p>
