      <p>The following are some of the doctrines that are taught in Christian churches about God's Law.</p>
      <ol class="arguments">
        <li>The Law has been done away with (voided/canceled/no longer applies).</li>
        <li>The Law was nailed to the Cross.</li>
        <li>The Law is a burden.</li>
        <li>Following the Law puts believers under bondage.</li>
        <li>The Law was fulfilled by Jesus so we don't have to follow it.</li>
        <li>We are under grace, not the Law. The New Covenant is a covenant of grace; the Old Covenant is a covenant of law.</li>
        <li>Christianity is not about following rules (the Law); it’s about a relationship with God/Jesus.</li>
        <li>Only the moral law of the Mosaic Law applies to Christians; the ceremonial and ritual laws have been canceled.</li>
        <li>Dual-Covenant Theology:  Mosaic Covenant only remains valid for Jews; Gentiles are not under the Law</li>
        <li>The 10 Commandments still apply for Christians, but only those that are repeated as commands in the New Testament.  Since the Sabbath command is not repeated, the Sabbath law (4th law) does not apply.</li>

      <p><u>Traditional Interpretation</u></p>  
      <p>Christians are not subject to obedience to God's Law.</p>  
      <p><u>Counter Scriptures</u></p>  
      <p>If the Law is not sinful and the Law defines what sin is, why would Christians not try to obey the Law? Jesus said on more than one occasion to people, “Go and sin no more” (John 5:14 and John 8:11).</p>

      <p><u>Counter Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>The law has not been made void for Christians but still applies.  Jesus tells us to not sin (i.e, break God’s Law) and that God’s Law will not pass away until heaven and earth pass away.  Paul says that he strives to serve/obey God’s Law.  He also says that we do not make void the Torah through our faith in Messiah, but rather we uphold (keep) the Torah.</p>
