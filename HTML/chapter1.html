      <p>Why should you and I, as Christians, care about God’s Law?  We will be answering this question throughout this book.  However, let me point out two very important reasons here.</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>1.1 Sin Is Breaking God's Law</h2>

      <p>The Apostle John tells us the primary reason Christians should be concerned about God’s Law.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Everyone who sins breaks God’s law, because sin is the same as breaking God’s law.<br></span>
        <cite>1 John 3:4 (CEV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We Christians know that we should not sin.  This is backed up by Jesus’ own words.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“Then neither do I condemn you,”<br></span>
        <span class="verse-text">Yeshua [Jesus] said.<br></span>
        <span class="verse-redletter">“Go and sin no more.”<br></span>
        <cite>John 8:11 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This verse is part of the account of the adulteress who was caught in the act of adultery and brought to Jesus (whose Hebrew name is Yeshua) by the scribes and Pharisees to see how Jesus would handle this situation.  There’s a lot of teaching associated with the details of this story, but for now, we're only concerned about the final thing Jesus spoke to her as recorded in John 8:11: "Go and sin no more".  Like this woman, we have all been caught in our sin.  That’s why we need a savior.  The penalty for our sin is death (which is another great reason we should not sin).</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br /></span>
        <cite>Romans 6:23 (KJV)</cite> 
      </blockquote>
      <p>Jesus did not come to condemn her (or you, or anyone else) but to save,</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>17</sup>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved.  <sup>18</sup>He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br /></span>
        <cite>John 3:17-18 (KJV)</cite> 
      </blockquote>
      <p>So as Jesus instructed her, He instructs us: "Go and <b><i>sin no more</i></b>".</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>1.2 Knowing God</h2>
      <img src="../Images/knowing-God.jpg" alt="Hand stretched out to the sky" class="knowing-God-image" title="How can I really know God?">

      <p>Do you really want to know God in a more intimate way than ever before?  Then learn and obey His Law.  God’s Law reveals the very character of God.  It informs us of what is important to Him, what pleases Him, and what displeases Him.  By obeying His commandments, we become more like Him, and, just as important, we express our love for Him.  God tells us this several times throughout the Bible.</p>
      <p>Moses said:</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Understand, therefore, that the LORD your God is indeed God.  He is the faithful God who keeps His covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes His unfailing love on those who love Him and obey His commandments.<br></span>
        <cite>Deuteronomy 7:9 (NLT)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">The LORD your God will be merciful only if you listen to His voice and keep all His commands that I am giving you today, doing what pleases Him.<br></span>
        <cite>Deuteronomy 13:18 (NLT)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Joshua said:</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">But take careful heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.<br></span>
        <cite>Joshua 22:5 (NKJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Jesus said:</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.<br></span>
        <cite>John 14:15 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me.  He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.<br></span>
        <cite>John 14:21 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>John the Apostle said:</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>3</sup>Now we know that we have come to know Him by this – if we keep His commandments.  <sup>4</sup>The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br></span>
        <cite>1 John 2:3-4 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Circling back to the start of this discussion, we see that sin is defined in 1<sup>st</sup> John 3:4 as breaking God’s Law.  So in order to <u>not</u> sin, we cannot break God’s Law.  If we are not to break God’s Law, then we have to know what His Law is.</p>
