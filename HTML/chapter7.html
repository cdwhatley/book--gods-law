      <p>Many churches teach that the concepts of law and grace are in contradiction to one another.  You are either living under the Law or living under grace.  It’s one or the other.</p>
      <p>Truth is, however, that God’s Law and grace work hand-in-hand.  This can be seen in more detail in the next chapter “Purpose of God’s Law”.  As long as God’s Law is not used in an unintended way (in a futile attempt to work our way to Heaven (to attain salvation through our own righteousness via observing God’s commands)), it doesn’t nullify grace.</p>
      <p>The wording of John 1:17 in most English Bible translations makes us think that God first used the Law to deal with mankind.  Then when Jesus came, God started to deal with humanity through grace.  That’s taught in dispensation theology, or dispensationalism.  Dispensationalism teaches that in different periods of human history, God deals with His people in different ways.  It teaches that the age of Law existed prior to Jesus advent, and now we are in the Church age (the age of Grace).</p>

      <p>Actually, God has always dealt with mankind using grace and mercy. Grace is getting something good that you don’t deserve.  Mercy is not getting the punishment for your sins that you do deserve (or having that punishment delayed).  The “but” in John 1:17 is in italics to show that the translators put the word in – it was not part of the original Greek text.  “But” makes the two sound opposed to each other (law and grace), but remove it and you take away the opposition so that both can (and do) exist simultaneously.</p>

      <p>But what exactly does this verse mean?  Following is a good explanation that I found on bibleref.com.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-block">Verse 17 explains an important difference between the ministries of Moses and Jesus.  Moses’ ministry brought knowledge of the law.  But the law could only show us how sinful and broken we were (Romans 3:20).  Rather than just bringing us truth, Jesus also brought us grace.  Instead of simply telling us that we were broken, Christ gave us a way to fix what was wrong.  This is an important common theme of the Bible.  Human efforts will always fall short, and everyone is corrupted with sin (Romans 3:23).  Instead of leaving us to face that uncomfortable truth alone, Jesus provided a way for us to experience forgiveness.  Merely doing good deeds can never save us, only God’s grace, through faith, can do that.  This is further symbolized in miracles.  Moses’ first miracle was turning water into blood, which is symbolic of judgment (Exodus 7:20).  Later, only those homes which had the blood of a lamb on their doors were “passed over” by God’s wrath (Exodus 12:26-28).  Jesus’ first miracle was turning water into wine – symbolic of blood – as a gracious gift (John 2:7-11).  Only those who accept Christ’s sacrifice of blood are spared from the judgment we all deserve (1st John 1:7).<br></span>

      <p>To sum up this topic of Law vs. grace, Duane Christensen in the World Bible Commentary on Deuteronomy states very plainly how the Law and grace work hand-in-hand.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-block">The popular view that identifies Law with the OT and gospel with the NT will certainly not stand up against a careful reading of the book of Deuteronomy, as G. Braulik has shown.  To understand Deuteronomy, one must recognize God’s prior grace to sinners, that is, the priority of gospel [grace] over law in the OT as well as the NT.  Though Deuteronomy stresses that obedience to God’s Torah is essential, it even more strongly emphasizes that such obedience is dependent on the grace of God.<br></span>

      <p>Under the Law is an idiom that means “under judgement, condemned by God’s Law, or under the penalty prescribed for breaking God’s Law”.  If we have accepted Jesus’ atonement for our sins, His free gift of salvation, we are no longer responsible for paying the penalty for our sins because His death on the cross paid that penalty for us!  Therefore, as born-again believers in Jesus, we are no longer “under the law”.  This doesn’t mean that we are not responsible for obeying God’s Law (i.e., that God’s Law is now null and void for believers in Messiah).  On the contrary, as Paul says in Romans 3:31 we uphold the Law.</p>

      <p>The transliterated Greek word for “uphold” is histemi (Strongs G2476).  Thayer’s Greek Definitions defines it this way:</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-text">"to uphold or sustain the authority or force of a thing”<br></span>

      </blockquote>
      <p>So, again, Paul in essence is saying that we obey God’s Law because we are saved, not too be saved.  And in fact, this agrees with the pattern set forth in Exodus.  God first saved His people (during the first Passover by the blood of a lamb), and then He gave His people His Law at Mount Sinai.  He gave His Law to His saved people, not to unbelievers.  God’s Law is for God’s people - it is not for the world (for those that do not believe in the God of Israel).</p>
      <p>The thing that makes the New Covenant better than the Mosaic Covenant is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Messiah made the final and perfect atonement for sin, and</li>
        <li>God gave us His Holy Spirit to help us obey His Law.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>24</sup>For the Messiah did not enter a sanctuary made with hands (only a model of the true one) but into heaven itself, so that He might now appear in the presence of God for us. <sup>25</sup>He did not do this to offer Himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another. <sup>26</sup>Otherwise, He would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world.

      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>1</sup>Therefore, no condemnation now exists for those in Christ Jesus, <sup>2</sup>because the Spirit’s law of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. <sup>3</sup>What the law could not do since it was limited by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending His own Son in flesh like ours under sin’s domain, and as a sin offering, <sup>4</sup>in order that the law’s requirement would be accomplished in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. <sup>5</sup>For those who live according to the flesh think about the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, about the things of the Spirit. <sup>6</sup>For the mind-set of the flesh is death, but the mind-set of the Spirit is life and peace. <sup>7</sup>For the mind-set of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit itself to God’s law, for it is unable to do so. <sup>8</sup>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. <sup>9</sup>You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God lives in you.

      <p>To elaborate on Romans 8:7-9, Paul says that the those who live according to the flesh (i.e., following/obeying/fulfilling their carnal desires) cannot please God because the mind of the flesh does not submit itself to God’s Law.  On the flip side are those that walk by the Spirit (i.e., live following/obeying the Holy Spirit).  Those who live according to God’s Spirit, then, do please God because they submit to God’s Law.</p>
