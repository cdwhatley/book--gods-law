      <p><u>Traditional Interpretation</u></p>  
      <p>The Law was a burden to keep. It was a yoke that was on the neck of the Jews that was heavy and burdensome. Christ's replacement of the Law, which was only the two commandments to love God and to love your neighbor, is a light yoke. His yoke is easy and His burden is light.</p>

      <p><u>Counter Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>We have already addressed the question of the Law of Christ vs. the Law of God and established that God's Law and Christ's Law are one and the same. (See <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>). If that is indeed the case, then what Yeshua said in Matthew 11:30 lines up perfectly with what John said in John 5:3 and Moses said in Deuteronomy 30:11, namely that God's Law is <b>not</b> a burden. This means that the yoke Peter talks about in Acts 15:10 is <b>not</b> God's Law.  So what was Peter talking about?<p>
      <p>The Pharisees believed in something they called the Oral Law. It was supposedly more commandments that God gave to Moses on Mt. Sinai that Moses did not write down in the Torah. These commandments were further details about how to exactly implement many of the commandments of the written Torah.  These commandments were alledgedly handed down orally from Moses to the elders. Each generation continued to pass down these unwritten commandments until the Romans destroyed the Temple (70 AD) and drove most of the Jews out of Israel (135 AD after the Bar Kokba revolt). In order to ensure the Oral Torah could be taught to Jews in all the nations they were scattered to, the Rabbis recorded the Oral Torah in a book called the Mishna (compiled between 200-220 AD by Rabbi Yehudah haNasi).  The Gemara (a series of commentaries and debates concerning the Mishna) was also created. Together the Mishna and Gemara form the Talmud. The Talmud today is the main text studied in Rabbinic Judaism, even more so than the written Torah.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
          <span class="quote-block">Rabbinic Judaism or Rabbinism has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century, after the codification of the Talmud. Rabbinic Judaism gained predominance within the Jewish diaspora between the 2nd to 6th centuries, with the development of the Oral Law (Mishna and Talmud) to control the interpretation of Jewish scripture (specifically the Masoretic Text) and to encourage the practice of Judaism in the absence of Temple sacrifice and other practices no longer possible, while awaiting the Third Temple.<br></span>

      <p>There is no mention anywhere in the Torah of commandments that were not recorded by Moses. In fact Exodus chapter 24 states that Moses wrote down all that God had commanded and put it in a book. This was known as the Book of the Law. </p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>3</sup>So Moses came and told the people all the words of Adonai as well as all the ordinances. All the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words which Adonai has spoken, we will do.” <sup>4</sup>So Moses wrote down all the words of Adonai, then rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mountain, along with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. ... <sup>7</sup>He took the Scroll of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. Again they said, “All that Adonai has spoken, we will do and obey.”<br></span>

      <p>The Book of the Law is referenced in Joshua chapter 1.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>7</sup>Only be very strong, and resolute to observe diligently the Torah which Moses, My servant commanded you.

      <p>The Oral Law was simply a collection of <b>man-made</b> commandments. Most of them were created in order to build "fences" around the written commandments in the Torah, in order to keep folks from breaking the written commandments.  The idea doesn't sound like a bad one necessarily, but it ended up leading to the creation of so many rules and regulations that it became a real pain (or <u>burden</u>) to keep. In fact, One of the best examples of this was the Sabbath laws.  The Rabbis created laws that governed exactly what you could and could not do on the Sabbath. Today those laws still exist in the Oral Torah - things like only being permitted to take so many steps away from your home, prohibiting the undoing of any tied or joined binding, and binding two pliant objects skillfully or permanently via twisting.  In fact, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat">39 creative activities</a> that were and are still prohibited by the Rabbis on the Sabbath.</p>
      <p>The primary problem with the Oral Torah is that God specifically commanded against it when he commanded that the Torah (written Torah) was not to be added to or subtracted from.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.<br></span>
        <cite>Deuteronomy 4:2 (ESV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In fact Jesus railed against this in Mark chapter 7 when he said that many of the Pharisees put precedence of following man-made commandments over following God's commandments.  And worse, yet, many of the man-made commandments violated God's commandments.</p>
      <p>So I believe that it is the Oral Law that Peter was referring to as the yoke that was too heavy to bear.</p>
