      <p>What is the purpose of God’s Law? In Paul’s time, some of the Jewish believers thought it was for salvation – that through keeping the Law, they would earn their salvation.  Paul clearly debunked this theology in a few of his letters.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>So if the purpose of God’s Law is not to save us through obedience to it, then what is its purpose?  It is two-fold: justification followed by sanctification.</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>8.1 Justification</h2>
      <img src="../Images/justified.jpg" alt="Cross serving as the T in the word Justified" class="justified-image" title="We are justified by Messiah's death on the Cross!">

      </audio>            
      <p>The first purpose of God’s Law is to lead us to salvation through Messiah (to <u>lead</u> us to justification before God, but <u>not to</u> justify us before God).</p>
      <p>It’s purpose is to lead us to salvation through Messiah, not to save us through perfect obedience to it.  There is only one way to be saved and that is through accepting the atoning gift of Jesus' (Yeshua’s) death.  Jesus paid our penalty of breaking God’s Law, but we have to accept that gift; we have to tell God that we want Yeshua’s sacrifice to atone for our sins.  If we don’t, we are responsible for atoning for our own sins, which is impossible.</p>
      <p>Paul states in Romans 10:1-4 that the goal of the Torah is not self-righteousness through good works (obedience to God’s Law) but the righteousness of Messiah gifted to us.  Good works will not save anyone because no one (except Messiah) can live an entire life without breaking at least one of God’s commandments.  God knew that and so He sent His son (Messiah Yeshua (a.k.a., Jesus Christ)) who lived a perfect life, never breaking God’s Law, so that God could impart His righteousness to us!  In other words, since Yeshua never sinned, he doesn’t have to pay the penalty for his own sin, leaving him worthy in God’s eyes to pay the penalty for the sins of others (the whole world in fact).  What a great and loving God we serve!</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">The next day, John sees Yeshua coming to him and says, “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!<br></span>
        <cite>John 1:29 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That process of leading us to salvation through Messiah is the process of making us aware that we need a savior to deliver us from the punishment of breaking God’s Law (which is eternal separation from God, i.e., true death).  This is done by revealing to us what sin is.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.<br></span>
        <cite>1 John 3:4 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Everyone who keeps sinning is violating Torah — indeed, sin is violation of Torah.<br></span>
        <cite>1 John 3:4 (CJB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Everyone who sins is breaking God’s law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God.<br></span>
        <cite>1 John 3:4 (NLT)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We can plainly see from 1<sup>st</sup> John 3:4 that <b><i>sin is breaking God’s Law</i></b>.  God, the Creator, is the one who defines what is right and what is wrong, the true standard of morality.  He does this in His Law.</p>
      <p>We know that sin is wrong and that we are not supposed to sin, even after we are saved – <b><i>especially</i></b> after we are saved.  Why?  Because when we are born-again into God’s kingdom, we not only accept His salvation (Yeshua), but we also pledge to make Him our Master.  In essence, we pledge to obey Him.  When we do <b>not</b> sin, we obey God.  When we sin, we disobey God.  It’s that simple.  So we need to know specifically what is right and what is wrong.  And that’s where God’s Law steps in.  <b><i>The Torah specifically defines right and wrong – all 613 commandments</i></b>.</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>8.2 Sanctification</h2>

      <p>So what do these academic-sounding terms – justification and sanctification – mean?  It is imperative that Christians understand these terms and the specific roles they play in our relationship with God.</p>
      <h3 class=subsection-title>Justification</h3>
      <ul class=just-sanct-list>
        <li>To set something right, or to declare righteous</li>
        <li>Christ’s righteousness is credited to believers through the act of salvation.</li>
        <li>The sole work of God</li>
        <li>To set something right, or to declare righteous</li>
        <li>An instantaneous event</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class=subsection-title>Sanctification</h3>
      <ul class=just-sanct-list>
        <li>A process, not an instantaneous event</li>
        <li>Starts immediately after salvation/justification and continues for the rest of your life</li>
        <li>Involves you working with God, applying God’s Word to your life to become more godly (more holy, less sinful)</li>
        <li>The goal is to be conformed to the image of Messiah.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth."<br></span>
        <cite>John 17:17 (NKJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The following quote will hopefully help to further clarify what sanctification is.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <span class="quote-text">To “sanctify” something is to set it apart for special use; to “sanctify” a person is to make him holy.  “Progressive” or “experiential” sanctification, as it is sometimes called, is the effect of obedience to the Word of God in one’s life. It is the same as growing in the Lord (2 Peter 3:18) or spiritual maturity. God started the work of making us like Christ, and He is continuing it (Philippians 1:6).<br></span>
        <cite><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/sanctification.html">gotquestions.org</a></cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">I am sure of this very thing – that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the Day of Messiah Yeshua.<br></span>
        <cite>Philippians 1:6 (TLV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, the bottom line is this.  God’s Law has a role to play in the life of an unbeliever, which is to lead him/her to salvation.  Salvation is justification.  Once saved, God’s Law has another role to play in the life of the believer.  That role is sanctification – the act of becoming holy (separated) unto God.</p>

      <h2 class=section-title>8.4 The Whole Counsel of God (Romans 1-8)</h2>

      <p>To add to this discussion of justification and sanctification, the book of Romans presents the whole counsel of God (Romans 1:18 – 8:30), which is the life stages for a believer in Yeshua.  These stages are as follows.</p>
      <ol class=whole-counsel-list>
        <li>Condemnation (Romans 1:18-3:20)</li>
        <p>Our rebellion against God (living life as we want rejecting God as Savior, Master, and King) condemns us to separation from Him.</p>
        <li>Justification (Romans 3:21-5:21)</li>
        <p>If we accept God’s gift of salvation through Yeshua, (Yeshua’s gift of taking our punishment for our sins), we are justified (made to be in right-standing) in God’s sight.</p>
        <li>Sanctification (Romans 6:1-8:17)</li>
        <p>If we also accept Yeshua as our LORD (King/master), not just our savior, and strive to learn and obey His commandments (given in His Word (The Bible) with the foundation being in the Torah)), God will sanctify us (set us apart to serve Him).  This life-long process includes the renewing of our mind to God’s ways that Paul speaks of in Romans 12:2.</p>
        <blockquote class="verse">
          <span class="verse-text">Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the will of God – what is good and acceptable and perfect.<br></span>
          <cite>Romans 12:2 (TLV)</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <li>Glorification (Romans 8:18-8:30)</li>
        <p>God will one day give us our new body and we will be with Him forever! In our new bodies, we will not sin.</p>
