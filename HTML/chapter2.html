      <p>God’s Law is also known as The Torah (pronounced Toe Rah’).  Torah is a Hebrew word.  It means “teaching, doctrine, or instruction”.  It is translated in most English Bibles as “law”.  That translation is not completely accurate, but it is there because of the translation of Torah from Hebrew into Greek.  Torah is translated into Greek as the word “nomos”.  The closest word we have for nomos in English is “law”.</p>
      <p>That’s the general definition of torah.  But what specifically is The Torah?</p>
      <p>The Torah is the first 5 books of the Bible that we know as Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.  These books were written by Moses under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.  The Torah was often quoted by Jesus as recorded in the New Testament Gospels.</p>
      <p>So, God’s Law is the Torah.  To reiterate, the best definition of Torah is teaching and instruction.  Isn’t that what a good parent gives to their children out of their love for them?  They teach them the right way to live; they instruct them how to behave so that they will have a good life.  If you are born again, God is your Father, and He is the best parent you will ever have.</p>

      <p>The next question we must answer is “Whose Law (Torah) is it?”  Is it God’s Torah or Moses Torah?  Reading the Bible in English, we often run across references to the Law being “Moses’ Law”, the “Mosaic Law”, and “as Moses commanded”.  Following are just a few examples.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Be very strong and continue obeying all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you do not turn from it to the right or left…<br></span>
        <cite>Joshua 23:6 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">Then He told them, <br></span>
        <span class="verse-redletter">”These are My words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”<br></span>
        <cite>Luke 24:44 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">For it is written in the law of Moses, Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out grain. Is God really concerned with oxen?<br></span>
        <cite>1 Corinthians 9:9 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">If anyone disregards Moses law, he dies without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.<br></span>
        <cite>Hebrews 10:28 (KJV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>All these passages naturally cause us to think the Torah is Moses’ law – Moses commands and instructions – ones that Moses created.  But is that true?  The answer is clear in Scripture.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">And keep your obligation to the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, commands, ordinances, and decrees.  This is written in the Law of Moses, so that you will have success in everything you do and wherever you turn.<br></span>
        <cite>1 Kings 2:3 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>1st Kings clearly shows that the Law of Moses is really God’s Law.  But let’s not build a doctrine on a single verse.  Following are more passages that back up this truth.</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>18</sup>All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain surrounded by smoke. When the people saw it they trembled and stood at a distance. <sup>19</sup>“You speak to us, and we will listen,” they said to Moses, “but don’t let God speak to us, or we will die.” <sup>20</sup>Moses responded to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that you will fear Him and will not sin.” <sup>21</sup>And the people remained standing at a distance as Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.<br></span>
        <cite>Exodus 20:18-21 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the preceding passage, God had Moses gather the Israelites together at the base of Mount Sinai so that He could speak His instructions (Torah) to them directly.  It was always His intention to speak directly to each individual believer.  But the people were so afraid after receiving the first 10 commandments that they asked Moses to be an intermediary between them and God – to get instructions directly from God and then come and tell them what God said.  Exodus 20:21 shows that Moses agreed and left the people to go up to God.  God then said to Moses:</p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-redletter">“These are the ordinances that you must set before them.”<br></span>
        <cite>Exodus 21:1 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><i>So God gave His commandments to Moses to give to the people.  Moses didn’t create these instructions himself.</i></b></p>
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>1</sup>Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live, enter, and take possession of the land Yahweh, the God of your fathers, is giving you. <sup>2</sup>You must not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, so that you may keep the commands of the LORD your God I am giving you. <sup>3</sup>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-Peor, for the LORD your God destroyed every one of you who followed Baal of Peor. <sup>4</sup>But you who have remained faithful to the LORD your God are all alive today. <sup>5</sup>Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess.<br></span>
        <cite>Deuteronomy 4:1-5 (HCSB)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Again, Scripture clearly shows that the commands Moses gave to the people were God’s commands, not Moses commands.</p>
