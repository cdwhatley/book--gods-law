      <p> God’s Law is also known as the Torah (pronounced Toe Rah’).  Torah – what a strange word to Christians.  Some perhaps have heard this word and know its meaning.  Others have heard it, but have no idea what it is.  Some have heard of the Torah, but think it is just a part of Judaism (a book or list of rules).</p>
      <p> I believe it is essential that all Christians know what the Torah is, and more importantly, the role it is designed to play in our relationship to Almighty God.  I wrote this book for that very reason.</p>
      <p> In 2006, while sitting in a Wednesday night service at the local Pentecostal church in Oneonta, Alabama, the LORD spoke clearly to me and it changed my life forever.  The lady teaching that night was lecturing on the “Jewish” Fall Feasts.  She was primarily using Perry Stone’s book, 40 Days of Teshuvah, as her source.  She started off the lecture by stating that we, as Christians, don’t celebrate the Jewish Fall Feasts, but that there are certain practices in Judaism that are performed to prepare for these Feasts which are good for Christians to do.  She was referring to the act of teshuvah, which is repenting to God and also making things right with your fellow man.</p>
      <p> Her analysis made perfect sense to me.  Just then I had a thought cross my mind that I soon realized was God speaking to me.  “Why don’t we (Christians) celebrate the Feasts?  After all, they are in the Bible.”  I had actually had that thought two years earlier in 2004 while studying the Book of Romans.  I had mentioned it in my study journal along with a note to further investigate the idea, which I didn’t end up doing.  That Autumn night in 2006, I vowed that I would not let anything get in the way of finding the answer.  I was determined not to get sidetracked this time.</p>
      <p> Fast forward a decade plus to the present – I am a totally changed man.  What does this have to do with Torah?  And you might still be asking, “What is Torah?”  I’m glad you asked.  Please read on!</p>
