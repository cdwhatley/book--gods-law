      <p><u>Traditional Interpretation</u></p>  
      <p>Today, under the New Covenant, believers are led by the Holy Spirit (traditionally referred to as "walking by the Spirit"). This means the Mosaic Law is not used to guide our lives, but rather the speaking and impressions of the Holy Spirit to our spirit. Under the Old Covenant, believers were led by the Law.</p>

      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>5</sup>For those who live according to the flesh think about the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, about the things of the Spirit. <sup>6</sup>For the mind-set of the flesh is death, but the mind-set of the Spirit is life and peace. <sup>7</sup>For the mind-set of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit itself to God’s law, for it is unable to do so. <sup>8</sup>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. <sup>9</sup>You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God lives in you. <br></span>

        <span class="verse-text">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am made out of flesh, sold into sin’s power.<br></span>

      </blockquote>
      <p><u>Counter Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>The opposing factions are not the Holy Spirit and God's Law, but instead <b>our flesh (i.e., our physical desires)</b> and the Holy Spirit. God's Law is <b>spiritual</b>; our flesh, however, is not. The Holy Spirit and God's Law are completely aligned. If we follow the Holy Spirit instead of our physical desires, we will follow God's Law.  If we follow our flesh, we will not follow God's Law. As Paul states, "the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit itself to God's Law".<p>
