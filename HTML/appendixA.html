          <p>These statistics reveal the shocking status of Christianity in America today, and the biblical illiteracy of most of those who call themselves Christians.  These statistics confirm the urgent need for Igniting Christians to Ignite America with Revival, by moving everyone, every day, closer to Jesus.
