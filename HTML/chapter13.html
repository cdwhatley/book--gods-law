        <span class="verse-text"><sup>21</sup>Tell me, you who want to live under the law, do you know what the law actually says? <sup>22</sup>The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons, one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife. <sup>23</sup>The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God’s promise. But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God’s own fulfillment of his promise. <sup>24</sup>These two women serve as an illustration of God’s two covenants. The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them. <sup>25</sup>And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia, because she and her children live in slavery to the law.<br></span>

      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text">So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don't get tied up again in slavery to the law.<br></span>
        <cite>Galatians 5:1 (NLT)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><u>Traditional Interpretation</u></p>  
      <p>A believer who follows God's Law (as opposed to being led by God's Spirit), puts themselves in bondage to that Law. Bondage here means in subjection to, or slavery to. So the believer is not free. Christ died to make us free from The Law because following it brings slavery upon us.</p>  
      <p><u>Counter Scriptures</u></p>  
      <blockquote class="verse">
        <span class="verse-text"><sup>15</sup>What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! <sup>16</sup>Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? <sup>17</sup>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, <sup>18</sup>and, having been set from from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. <sup>19</sup>I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.<br></span>
        <cite>Romans 6:15-19 (ESV)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><u>Counter Interpretation</u></p>
      <p>Paul said that we are slaves regardless. We are either slaves to sin or slaves to righteousness. <p>
